# GuessTheFlag

GuessTheFlag is an engaging iOS game built as part of the Day 20-22 challenges in the ["100 Days of SwiftUI"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) tutorial series by [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). This app presents users with three different flags and challenges them to select the correct flag from the options provided. Additionally, it keeps track of the player's score and allows them to reset and play again after completing a round of 8 questions.

## How to Play

2. **Score Tracking**: Keep an eye on your score as you answer each question.
